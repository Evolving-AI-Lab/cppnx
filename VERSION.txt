Version: 0.4
- Slightly improved positioning.
- Wider spread of nodes in layered positioning.
- Now able to open .zip files directly.
- Better support for selecting multiple connections/nodes at once.
- Options will now properly grey out when not available.
- Can now produce a set of pictures for each connection.
- Can now produce a movie for each connection (highly experimental).
- Fixed a bug where adding an input node to the sidebar would turn the node black.
- Fixed a bug where nodes could suddenly change position when selecting and deselecting nodes and connections.
- Fixed a known memory leak when opening files.

Version: 0.4.1
- Fixed a bug where hitting 'film' and then 'cancel' would start a scan anyway.
- Fixed a bug where having more labels than fit on the screen would cause the application to grow beyond the size of the screen.
- Fixed a bug where filenames produced by film would not be sortable by ffmpeg external application.
- Fixed a bug were the 'film' option has a different name in the drop-down menu.
- Title bar now show the name of the file.
- Labeled nodes no longer show whether a connection is positive or negative, but show the label color instead. This option can be changed in the new view menu.
- There is no longer an x in the node names.

Version: 0.4.2
- When a label gets deleted, unlabel all objects with that label.
- Save/Load both original and current weights.

Version: 0.4.3
- Partially implemented undo functionality. Can undo changes in weight, adding and removing labels, applying labels and adding nodes to the sidebar. 

Version: 0.5
- Fully implemented undo functionality. Can undo changes in weight, position, adding and removing labels, applying labels and adding nodes to the sidebar. 
- Skip frames to increase scanning speed.
- Highlight the label of an object when it gets selected.
- Ability to rename labels. 
- Ability to change label colors after the fact.
- Added instructions to install cppn-x with ffmpeg for direct recording. 

Version: 0.5.1
- When clicking on a link its ID is displayed next to the slider.
- Labels and nodes in the sidebar can now be moved to different positions using drag-and-drop.
- Label, nodes, edges and the nodes in the sidebar now have consistent functionalities in that they can be selected and they now support context menus. They also have the same selection colors.
- If you create a label while having items selected the new label will now be applied to the selected items.
- Disabled the 'slightly improved positioning' of version 0.4 for faster loading times.
- Nodes now have their id as a title and have there depth as an additional annotation.
- Output-nodes have a slightly different border color to make them easier to spot when zoomed-out.
- Fixed a bug where if a label got highlighted and then the object causing the highlight got a different label, the label would remain lit.
- Fixed a bug where the canvas would not resize properly when moving a node from the edge of the canvas to beyond the second node.
- Fixed a bug where the name of the file displayed would not change in the title of the screen.
- Fixed a bug where the 'reset all' button would be grey-ed out when no edge was selected even though the 'reset all' functionality does not require an edge being selected.
- Fixed a bug where long label names would increase the size of the labels window with no way of decreasing it.
- Fixed a bug where the colors in colored genomes where not correctly displayed.

Version: 0.6.0
- Bookends are now saved to the file.
- You can now export the current state of one or more nodes (both in the main view and in the sidebar) to jpeg pictures.
- The final image is now always produced when filming

Version: 0.7.0
- ONP was added as a node placement
- Display red-blue modularity for all modules that add to the modularity Q-score.
- The modularity (Q-score) of each network is now shown in the bottom left of the application.
- Nodes and connection can now be removed (this action can be undone to get them back).
- When selecting a label, all connections and nodes with that label will now be selected. Pressing the label again will cause those connections and nodes to 'blink'.
- Cppn-x now uses the same sigmoid and gaussian tables as picbreeder, meaning that pictures like 4266 are now correctly displayed.
- Added a 'start here' button. Checking the button causes all scans and films to start from the current position, scan to the start, scan to the end and then scan back to the initial position.
- A pre-compiled version is now also available on Mac.
- Added the possibility to show curved lines instead of straight lines.
- When showing modules the image of each node is now replaced with its module color.
- When saving a node or a film you can now select different image formats. All supported formats are listed meaning that this could provide a workaround for the fact that the jpg format is not always available on all windows machines.
- Precision for start, end and step were reduced to 2.
- Fixed a bug where the step-size was not saved to file.
- Fixed a bug where reseting with no changes or drag-and-dropping something to the same location would cause an action to be added to the undo stack.
- Fixed a bug where, when selecting a node after selecting an edge, the ID displayed would still be the ID of the edge.
- Fixed a bug where nodes added to the sidebar would not update properly after loading the file.
- Fixed a bug where, when the window was in fullscreen move, the window moved when when filming causing part of the application to go off screen.
- Fixed a bug where the program would not ask if you want to save a modified file upon loading a different file.
- Fixed a bug where an oddly named frame would be produced.
- Fixed a bug where the jpg format was not available on Windows.

Version: 0.8.0
- Nodes and connections can be added, but adding edges still crashes the program.
- The curve of edges can be adjusted, though this feature is very much buggy.
- Networks can be loaded by number, if the Picbreeder database is present and known.
- It is possible to switch between generations, if the Picbreeder database is present and known.
- The entire network can now be exported at a `higher than displayed' resolution with the `snapshot' option.
- The activation function of a node can be changed (though the implementation is not very user friendly).
- You can import labels from a different network.
- You can show the differences between this network and a different network.
- You can import the positions from a different network.
- You can automatically select an unlabeled connection.
- You can search for a node with a particular ID.
- The view options have changed slightly to allow for more versatility.
- You can create labels according to the optimal modular split, so you can chose different colors for the labels.
- You can give a particular label to a node by adding := to the name of the label. This will cause the label to show in a circle on top of the connection.
- The program can now display a legend (only available from code).

Version: 0.9.0
- Nodes and connections can be added, and adding edges no longer crashes the program.
- The program can now display a legend, toggled in the "view" menu.
- Program can now zoom with menu options and shortcuts.

Version: 1.0.0
- Genomes can now be downloaded by ID from an online repository.
- CPPN-X can now load csv matrices.
- Fixed some issues where the program would crash when loading a new cppn after a previous cppn was already loaded.
- Added an icon for CPPN-X.
- CPPN-X should now compile under linux based systems.

Known issues:
- Undoing or redoing a 'reset all' rapidly selects all nodes that were changed.
- Selecting a node sometimes causes that node to move.

Priority:
- bug fixes

Wish-list:
- Scan interaction effects.
- Calculate and display hierarchy.
- Add notes to objects.
- Copy nodes according to "node duplication".
- Automatically calculate and display various statistics such as modularity, hierarchy, red-blue modularity (and maybe split the network into even more parts).
- Add other node placements.
- Less pixelated pictures.
- Automatic network scan where it zooms in on the output node, automatically selects a connection and scans over its weight, ask the user to give the connection a label, and then selects the next connection. At the end of this process you should have a fully annotated network.
