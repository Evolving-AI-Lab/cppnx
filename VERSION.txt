This is the cppn-x implementation of the Evolving Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Wyoming.
Current version: 0.2 (beta)

Version: 0.1
- First version to uploaded to the git repository.
- Includes loading pic-breeder genome files, showing each node in the network as a small thumbnail.
- Supports zooming, scrolling and moving nodes.
- Supports selecting connections and changing there weight by sliding, clicking, writing a number or automatically scanning.

Version: 0.2
- Labeling nodes and connections with color labels.
- Writing the genomes including color information to a file.

Version: 0.3
- Show negative values.
- Save original weights.
- Reset all button.
- Reset scan on reset.
- Increase speed of scan.
- Labeled nodes with their activation functions.
- Show labels more clearly.
- Show output connection on the top of each node and show input connections on the bottom of each node.
- Separate panel for special nodes.
- Labeled links with colors.
- Prevent crashes by invalid options.
- Added support for color genomes.
- Added support multi-genome files.
- Added a visualization of the final picture.
- Works on windows.

Version: 0.4
- Slightly improved positioning.
- Wider spread of nodes in layered positioning.
- Now able to open .zip files directly.
- Better support for selecting multiple connections/nodes at once.
- Options will now properly grey out when not available.
- Can now produce a set of pictures for each connection.
- Can now produce a movie for each connection (highly experimental).
- Fixed a bug where adding an input node to the sidebar would turn the node black.
- Fixed a bug where nodes could suddenly change position when selecting and deselecting nodes and connections.
- Fixed a known memory leak when opening files.


Known issues:
- None

Wish-list:
- Create a picture for an arbitrary node.
- Scan interaction effects.
- Support for knockout experiments.
- Save/Load both original and current weights.
- Less pixelated pictures.
- Improve connection visualization with curved or 90 degree bend lines.
- Automatic network scan where it zooms in on the output node, automatically selects a connection and scans over its weight, ask the user to give the connection a label, and then selects the next connection. At the end of this process you should have a fully annotated network.
- Add or remove nodes and connections.
- Copy nodes according to "node duplication".
- Automatically calculate and display various statistics such as modularity, hierarchy, red-blue modularity (and maybe split the network into even more parts).
- Select different node placements (my circle style, graphviz style, layered style)
