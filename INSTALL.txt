These are the installation steps for UNIX and MAC systems.

*** Install cmake ***
See www.cmake.org for instructions.


*** Install the boost library ***
Download the boost library from www.boost.org
	Install preferably in the default location: /usr/local and build at least:
	- boost_system
	- boost_filesystem
	- boost_thread
	- boost_regex

If you are on a unix based system you can:
	- Extract the library to /usr/local
	- Open a terminal and go to the boost directory (cd /usr/local/boost_1_53_0)
	- Run: sudo bootstrap.sh
	- Run: ./b2 install

If you are on a windows system you can:
	- Get an installer from www.boostpro.com
Or:
	- Extract the library to C:\Program Files\boost
	- Open the command line a go the the boost directory (C:\Program Files\boost)
	- Run: bootstrap
	- Run: .\b2

*** Install QT 4.8 ***
Go to http://qt-project.org/downloads and download QT 4.8


*** Compile cppn-x ***
In general there are two way to install cppn-x

== From a script ==
- Open compile.sh and check that all paths are correct. The compile.sh will have additional comments for setting. 
- Run compile.sh

The executable 'cppn-x' should be placed in the 'out' folder.

== Using cmake directly ==
- Create a new folder, for example my_build (mkdir my_build)
- Change the directory to this folder (cd my_build)
- Run cmake, targeting this directory as the source directory (cmake ..)

The executable 'cppn-x' should be placed in the 'out' folder.

Note: the CMakeLists.txt has been configured to disallow 'in-source' builds.
This not only means that running 'cmake .' results in an error,
it also means that, if you accidentally run 'cmake .',
other builds will also fail. 
To resolve this situation remove CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles or run 'clean.sh'

*** Run cppn-x ***
Just run 'cppn-x' in the 'out' folder. Have Fun!
