This is the cppn-x implementation of the Evolving Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Wyoming.
Current version: 0.4.2 (beta)

Version: 0.1
- First version to uploaded to the git repository.
- Includes loading pic-breeder genome files, showing each node in the network as a small thumbnail.
- Supports zooming, scrolling and moving nodes.
- Supports selecting connections and changing there weight by sliding, clicking, writing a number or automatically scanning.

Version: 0.2
- Labeling nodes and connections with color labels.
- Writing the genomes including color information to a file.

Version: 0.3
- Show negative values.
- Save original weights.
- Reset all button.
- Reset scan on reset.
- Increase speed of scan.
- Labeled nodes with their activation functions.
- Show labels more clearly.
- Show output connection on the top of each node and show input connections on the bottom of each node.
- Separate panel for special nodes.
- Labeled links with colors.
- Prevent crashes by invalid options.
- Added support for color genomes.
- Added support multi-genome files.
- Added a visualization of the final picture.
- Works on windows.

Version: 0.4
- Slightly improved positioning.
- Wider spread of nodes in layered positioning.
- Now able to open .zip files directly.
- Better support for selecting multiple connections/nodes at once.
- Options will now properly grey out when not available.
- Can now produce a set of pictures for each connection.
- Can now produce a movie for each connection (highly experimental).
- Fixed a bug where adding an input node to the sidebar would turn the node black.
- Fixed a bug where nodes could suddenly change position when selecting and deselecting nodes and connections.
- Fixed a known memory leak when opening files.

Version: 0.4.1
- Fixed a bug where hitting 'film' and then 'cancel' would start a scan anyway.
- Fixed a bug where having more labels than fit on the screen would cause the application to grow beyond the size of the screen.
- Fixed a bug where filenames produced by film would not be sortable by ffmpeg external application.
- Fixed a bug were the 'film' option has a different name in the drop-down menu.
- Title bar now show the name of the file.
- Labeled nodes no longer show whether a connection is positive or negative, but show the label color instead. This option can be changed in the new view menu.
- There is no longer an x in the node names.

Version: 0.4.2
- When a label gets deleted, unlabel all objects with that label.
- Save/Load both original and current weights.

Version: 0.4.3
- Partially implemented undo functionality. Can undo changes in weight, adding and removing labels, applying labels and adding nodes to the sidebar. 

Version: 0.5
- Fully implemented undo functionality. Can undo changes in weight, position, adding and removing labels, applying labels and adding nodes to the sidebar. 
- Skip frames to increase scanning speed.
- Highlight the label of an object when it gets selected.
- Ability to rename labels. 
- Ability to change label colors after the fact.
- Added instructions to install cppn-x with ffmpeg for direct recording. 

Version: 0.5.1
- When clicking on a link its ID is displayed next to the slider.
- Labels and nodes in the sidebar can now be moved to different positions using drag-and-drop.
- Label, nodes, edges and the nodes in the sidebar now have consistent functionalities in that they can be selected and they now support context menus. They also have the same selection colors.
- If you create a label while having items selected the new label will now be applied to the selected items.
- Disabled the 'slightly improved positioning' of version 0.4 for faster loading times.
- Nodes now have their id as a title and have there depth as an additional annotation.
- Output-nodes have a slightly different border color to make them easier to spot when zoomed-out.
- Fixed a bug where if a label got highlighted and then the object causing the highlight got a different label, the label would remain lit.
- Fixed a bug where the canvas would not resize properly when moving a node from the edge of the canvas to beyond the second node.
- Fixed a bug where the name of the file displayed would not change in the title of the screen.
- Fixed a bug where the 'reset all' button would be grey-ed out when no edge was selected even though the 'reset all' functionality does not require an edge being selected.
- Fixed a bug where long label names would increase the size of the labels window with no way of decreasing it.
- Fixed a bug where the colors in colored genomes where not correctly displayed.

Version: 0.6.0
- Bookends are now saved to the file.
- You can now export the current state of one or more nodes (both in the main view and in the sidebar) to jpeg pictures.
- The final image is now always produced when filming



Known issues:
- Reseting all nodes while no nodes were modified causes an action to be added to the undo stack and causes the file to be marked as modified. The same is true for dragging and dropping a label or node to the same position.
- Nodes on the sidebar are not written to the file (the original nodes in the cppn are unaffected).
- Undoing or redoing a 'reset all' rapidly selects all nodes that were changed.
- There is a bug were, if the window is in fullscreen mode, the window is moved when filming, causing part of the application to go off-screen.
- The step-size is not saved, and it does not change when selecting different edges.
- The precision for begin, end and step-size might be a bit too high.
- When selecting a node after selecting an edge the ID displayed will still be the ID of the edge.

Priority:
- Automatically calculate and display various statistics such as modularity, hierarchy, red-blue modularity (and maybe split the network into even more parts). [This would be great. Note that red-blue modularity has two colors only for a network with two modules, so what you really mean is a view in which nodes are colored by membership in modules, which would be great." Showing the modularity and hierarchy numbers would be great too.]

- ONP node placement

- Add or remove nodes and connections. [You can eliminate connections by setting them to 0, and you will be able to eliminate nodes via the knockout feature above, no? If so, this is not a high priority]

Wish-list:
- Create a custom film.
- Support for knockout experiments. [I think by this you mean clicking on a node and saying "deactivate" which grays it out an all incoming/outgoing connections and sets them to 0]
- Add notes to objects.
- Create a picture for an arbitrary node.
- Scan interaction effects.
- Add or remove nodes and connections.
- Copy nodes according to "node duplication".
- Automatically calculate and display various statistics such as modularity, hierarchy, red-blue modularity (and maybe split the network into even more parts).
- Improve connection visualization with curved or 90 degree bend lines.
- Add other node placements.
- Less pixelated pictures.
- Automatic network scan where it zooms in on the output node, automatically selects a connection and scans over its weight, ask the user to give the connection a label, and then selects the next connection. At the end of this process you should have a fully annotated network.
- Load by number (if the root folder is known).


Category assignment pending answers to my questions: 
- Improve connection visualization with curved or 90 degree bend lines. [is this hard? it would be nice if connections never went under nodes. that's the main thing, so if this is not too hard let's do it]
